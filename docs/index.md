# Documents for CSE 830

**CSE 830: Design & Theory of Algorithms**

Below are the documents and links needed for Fall 2020.

**[Syllabus](https://mercere99.github.io/CSE-830/syllabus)** - provides basic information about the course including how you will be graded.

**[Slack Discussion Board](https://cse830.slack.com)** a place for asynchronous discussions and Q&A sessions.

**Zoom** will be used for all class sessions.  The Zoom link has been e-mailed to all students and can be found pinned to the #general channel in the course Slack.

Below are the week-by-week topics that will be covered.  Links will be added at least 24 hours before the first class each week (and often sooner).  The current week will be in bold in the directory on the left of this page.
